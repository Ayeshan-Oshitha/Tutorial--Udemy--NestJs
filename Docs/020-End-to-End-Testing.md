# What is End To End Testing ?

End-to-end tests include the test database as well, whereas unit tests **do not** integrate with the database or any third-party services.

For end-to-end testing, we use Jest along with another library called **supertest**.

Unit tests are usually placed inside the src directory, while end-to-end tests are placed inside the test directory.
