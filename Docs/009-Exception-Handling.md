Within the filter boundary, NestJS takes care of handling exceptions automatically. (NestJS has a built-in **exception handling layer**. If an exception is thrown inside your application and isnâ€™t caught, NestJS will automatically handle it using its **global exception filter**. By default, it turns unhandled exceptions into a proper HTTP response.)
